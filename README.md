# Discord-Auggie
What branch is working on what?  
Drew: Request Repo Data   
Brenna: Add repos to list  
Tarek: Schedule Timed Messages  
Huzaifa: Return users list of repos  

Rather than creating a fork of Augur, we created our own repository through which we will expand upon Discord-Auggie. We will use Augur’s Auggie (https://github.com/chaoss/augur-auggie) as a starting point. The development process will involve some reconfiguration of the original Auggie, as well as the integration of new commands. So far, we have created a simple Discord bot in order to show proof of concept for connecting to Discord’s API. We are still determining how to connect to Augur’s API; we have started working on this with the help of the original Auggie’s repository. This is our current idea of what Discord-Auggie should include after completion:

    Reconfigured files from chaoss/augur-auggie
    Request Repo Data command
    Add repos to list command
    Schedule times messages command
    Return user’s list of repos command

Sprint Goals:
Sprint 3:

    Reconfigure Auggie to work with Discord
    Start developing commands

Sharing: 

    Video will show the original Auggie’s commands working in Discord
    We will also show where we are with developing new commands

Sprint 4:

    Commands function properly
    Reevaluate original requirements and decide what can be added or changed

Final Code:

    Update commands based upon reevaluation in Sprint 4
